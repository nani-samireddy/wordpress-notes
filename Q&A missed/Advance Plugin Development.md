### Multi-site drop-ins
- sunrise.php
- blog-deleted.php
- blog-inactive.php
- blog-suspended.php

### brief about sunrise.php
- If SUNRISE constant is set to true, then this drop-in executed before Multisite is loaded. This drop-in loads early in the WordPress loading sequence, before mu-plugins, any active plugins, and the active theme. Because of this, what can be done in sunrise.php is limited, and confined to executing pure PHP to set constants that override WordPress Core behavior.

#### Does WordPress deletes the expired transients?
Yes, WordPress infrequently cleans out expired transients. To prevent expired transients from building up in the database, itâ€™s a good practice to always remove your transient once you are done with it and no longer need it.
