- A template in WordPress is a file that defines the structure and layout of a specific type of content, such as a page or a post. It is used to display the content on the front end of the website. Templates are typically used to create the overall design and layout of the site, and they can be customized to display different content based on the type of page or post.
- A template part, on the other hand, is a smaller reusable piece of code that can be included within a template. It is used to define specific sections of a template, such as headers, footers, sidebars, or other content areas. Template parts are useful for organizing and reusing code across multiple templates, and they can help to maintain consistency and modularity in the design of a WordPress site.
