# How a plugin Loads
WordPress follows a specific order to load plugins, ensuring everything runs smoothly behind the scenes. Here's a breakdown of the process:

1. **Prioritizing Essentials:** First, WordPress checks for must-use plugins. These reside in a special folder (`mu-plugins`) and are always loaded regardless of activation status. This is typically reserved for critical plugins bundled with the theme or core functionality.
    
2. **Network Activation (Multisite Only):** In a multisite setup, WordPress then loads any plugins activated network-wide. These plugins apply to all sites within the network.
    
3. **Activating Your Choices:** Finally, WordPress tackles the active plugins you've chosen for your site. It retrieves a list from the `wp_options` database table (specifically, the `active_plugins` entry) and works its way through them alphabetically.
    

**Important Points to Remember:**

- WordPress only loads one file per plugin initially. This file (often named `the-plugin-name.php`) contains basic information like title and description.
- Each plugin is responsible for loading its additional files using functions like `require_once` or `wp_enqueue_script`.
- The order of active plugins can potentially affect functionality if plugins rely on hooks created by others. However, WordPress ensures all plugins are loaded before the `plugins_loaded` hook fires, giving them a chance to interact.

By following these steps, WordPress ensures a structured loading process for your plugins, allowing them to integrate seamlessly and provide the features you need for your website.
